        <p class="mb-4">
            You and MealOps agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in
            a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and MealOps therefore agree that, before either you
            or MealOps
            demands arbitration against the other, we will personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference,
            in a
            good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this mutual Arbitration Agreement. If you are
            represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate
            in the
            conference. The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or
            her intent to initiate an
            informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such
            notice,
            unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. To notify MealOps that you intend to initiate an
            informal
            dispute resolution conference, email <strong class="font-bold">mealops.help@gmail.com</strong>, providing your name, telephone
            number associated with your MealOps account (if any), the email address associated with your MealOps
            account, and a
            description of your claim. In the interval between the party receiving such notice and the informal dispute
            resolution
            conference, the parties shall be free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims. Engaging in an
            informal
            dispute resolution conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The
            statute of
            limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute
            resolution
            process required by this paragraph.

            respects. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing
            arbitration
            agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply. Before a party may begin an arbitration proceeding,
            that party
            must send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying completion of the informal dispute
            resolution
            conference pursuant to paragraph 11(b). If this notice is being sent to MealOps, it must be sent by email to
            <a href="mailto:mealops.help@gmail.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">mealops.help@gmail.com</a> or
            by mail to General Counsel, at

                class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">mealops.inquiries@gmail.com</a>. The
            arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. pursuant to the most current version of its rules
            available at
            <a href="https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules/"

            pursuant to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
            Arbitration demands filed with ADR Services, Inc. must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing
            address, and
            e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the
            factual
            bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the
            amount in
            controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars (any request for injunctive relief or attorneys’ fees shall
            not count
            toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks the payment of
            money); and (4)
            the signature of the party seeking arbitration. The fees that shall apply to arbitrations administered by
            ADR
            Services, Inc. are set forth on ADR Services, Inc.’s website, available as of December 21, 2020 at

                class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/</a>. Payment of all
            filing, administration, and arbitration fees will
            be governed by ADR Services, Inc.’s Fee Schedule and ADR Services, Inc.’s rules. However, if required by
            law, MealOps will
            pay the portion of the initial case opening fees (if any) that exceeds the filing fee to file the case in a
            court of
            competent jurisdiction embracing the location of the arbitration. If ADR Services, Inc. is not available to
            arbitrate,
            the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration
            conducted by
            telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at
            another
            mutually agreed location. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider shall administer
            the
            arbitration, only a court (and not an arbitrator or arbitration administrator) can resolve that dispute, and
            the
            arbitration shall be stayed until the court resolves that dispute. The parties agree that all of the
            arbitration
            proceedings, including any discovery, hearings, and rulings, shall be confidential to the fullest extent
            permitted by
            law. If at any time the arbitrator or arbitration administrator fails to enforce the terms of this
            Arbitration
            Agreement, either party may seek to enjoin the arbitration proceeding in court, and the arbitration shall
            automatically
            be stayed pending the outcome of that proceeding.
