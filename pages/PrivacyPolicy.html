    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At MealOps, we connect individuals with the best meal programs and services available, enabling users to meet
        their dietary and nutritional needs with ease and convenience. In turn, we help third-party companies and
        athletic programs efficiently manage and offer their meal-related services.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how MealOps, Inc. and its affiliates (“MealOps”, “we”, “our”, or “us”)
        collect, process, retain, and disclose your Personal Information when providing its services, including, but not

    <p>This Policy does not apply to personnel of athletic programs or third-party companies using our services, which
        may be subject to separate privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>II. What Personal Information does MealOps collect or process?</h2>
    <p>Personal Information is any information that MealOps can reasonably use to identify you, whether that information

            government-issued identification documents, which we may process in limited circumstances for legal and

        <li><strong>Geolocation Information,</strong> if you have consented by enabling location access, we may receive
            and store your precise location information, including when our apps are running in the foreground (our app
            is open and on screen) or background (our app is open, not on screen) of your device. You may use our
            Services without enabling the collection of precise location information from your device; however, this may
            impact your experience including the accuracy of service delivery and/or the availability of certain
            content, features, and functionality (e.g., you may have to manually enter your address). If you have not
            allowed us to receive your precise location, we can only determine your approximate location. To opt-out of
            location sharing after turning it on, please refer to your device's settings or the privacy settings within
            the MealOps app, if available.</li>

            operating system and version, preferred language, hardware model identifiers, browser information including
            type and settings, and other device information.</li>
        <li><strong>Information from Co-Branded or Third-Party Offers,</strong> we may collect information that you use
            to register for, and your activity with, third parties, in connection with co-branded or third-party offers
            from us and our partners, such as when you enroll for co-branded credit card opportunities with our credit
            card partners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the information identified above that you choose to provide us (specifically, government-issued
        identification, which we receive when we verify age and identity for certain services to prevent fraud and
        demonstrate legal and regulatory compliance, and precise location information, which we receive to facilitate
        service delivery and certain content, features, and functionality within our Services), may be considered
        sensitive Personal Information under the laws of some jurisdictions. You can turn off MealOps’s ability to
        collect and use precise location at any time in your app settings. We do not use any sensitive Personal
        Information for purposes other than as reasonably expected by an average consumer to provide our Services, for
        legal, security and safety purposes, and without the purpose of inferring characteristics about an individual.
        Where legally required, MealOps will collect and process sensitive Personal Information only with consent.</p>
    <p>When we process de-identified information, we maintain and use the information in de-identified form, and do not
        attempt to re-identify the information, except as permitted by applicable law.</p>
