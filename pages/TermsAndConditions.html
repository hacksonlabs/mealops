                MealOps may offer SMS messaging to deliver meal ordering links, reminders, and service alerts for your organization. Participation requires explicit consent captured through the MealOps shared cart web form or another mechanism we make available. When a team member logs in without a recorded preference, the shared cart displays their phone number alongside an SMS consent checkbox so they can opt in or decline.

            <p class="text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Either party may terminate for convenience with written notice if no separate agreement states otherwise.
                We may suspend or terminate access immediately if: (a) you breach these Terms, (b) continued use poses a
                security or legal risk, or (c) we discontinue the Services. Upon termination, access to the platform ends
                and you should export your Customer Data within the timeframe we communicate.

                These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules.
                Any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services will be handled through good-faith negotiations. If
                the parties cannot resolve a dispute within thirty days, either party may pursue mediation or binding
                arbitration in Delaware, unless a different forum is required by a separate written agreement. Nothing in
                this section prevents either party from seeking interim relief in court for intellectual-property
                violations or unauthorized use of confidential information.

                We may update these Terms to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. When we do, we will revise
                the effective date and, if the changes are material, provide notice through the Services or email. Your
                continued use of the Services after the updated Terms become effective constitutes acceptance.
